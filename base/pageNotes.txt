# Homepage Outline (pseudo)
1. Hero / Masthead
   - simple centered headline + subheading and CTA copy
   - stick to minimal markup; decorative backgrounds handled in CSS

2. Save-the-Date carousel
   - rotating carousel pulling images from `media/eventCarousel`
   - slide indicators + prev/next controls
   - follow with short block listing date/time/location + vibe bullets

3. Event Photo Grid
   - intro copy + 5 photos arranged as responsive grid
   - hover zoom/popout effect so cards feel tactile instead of sliding

4. Welcome / Vibe section
   - two paragraphs describing craft + healing community
   - include pullquote and expanded testimonial box under copy

5. Community Voices
   - row of three short quote cards
   - additional vendor testimonial block below quotes (paragraphs)

6. Mission / Story
   - “Our Story” heading, quote about building a space, mention 70+ events
   - right column photo of team (eventPhotos/third-eye-craft-selfie-with-poster)

7. Grounding Message
   - centered section with “This isn’t just a party — it’s a practice.” copy

8. Footer / Signal + Form
   - short “Get Connected” card describing Signal updates
   - Signal CTA button + remote QR image
   - single “Want to Vend?” card (referral focus)
   - embedded Google Form for updates/contact straight below cards

9. Merch Push
   - two-column layout (image + merch copy + Signal CTA button)
   - emphasize handmade merch + link to Signal group for inventory

General notes:
- Base styles from `css/main.css` + Bootstrap utilities keep spacing consistent
- Tone remains warm, conversational, and community-first (see Language Guide)
- Keep outlines lean; use this file for section structure rather than fixed copy
