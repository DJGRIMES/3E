📢 Voice Principles for the Website
                                             1. Lead with excitement – start sections with an invitation or exclamation.

                                             2. Speak directly to the reader – use “you” language, as if chatting with a friend.

                                             3. Celebrate community effort – always elevate local, collective, and creative contributions.

                                             4. Leave room for emotion – testimonials, about pages, and event descriptions should include language that honors feelings.
