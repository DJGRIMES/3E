🧱 1. Site-Wide Style Guide
Brand Tone
 Warm, welcoming, and grounded in joy. The voice should feel like a kind friend guiding you through an uplifting, vibrant, community-centered experience. Emphasis on inclusivity, accessibility, and a celebratory spirit.
Color Palette (Hex Codes)
* Psychedelic Purple: #8E44AD

* Earthy Green: #27AE60

* Warm Gold: #F39C12

* Soft Coral: #E67E22

* Cloud White: #FDFEFE

* Deep Night: #2C3E50

Typography
   * Headers: Retro-style serif (e.g., "Shrikhand" or "Pacifico")

   * Body: Clean sans-serif (e.g., "Inter" or "Open Sans") for readability

   * Playful accents welcome in headers, especially for calls to action

UI Style
 Retro hippie-psychedelic meets modern card-based layout. Use lots of rounded corners, layered visuals, and hand-drawn or organic shapes. Include texture and depth via layered photos or color overlays. Interactivity should feel soft and human, not mechanical.
