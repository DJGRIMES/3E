  <h2>A Celebration of Creative Medicine</h2>
  <p>Third Eye Craft Affair is a joyful gathering of art, healing, and community care. Imagine your favorite farmer’s market met your favorite craft fair... and brought their coolest friends.</p>
  <p>Here, caregivers, artists, and wild-hearted folks come together to share medicine, dance to funk, and build something beautiful. It’s wholistic, educational, and radically welcoming.</p>

    <h3 class="testimonial-title">What the Third Eye Craft Affair Means to Me</h3>
    <p>The Third Eye Craft Affair has always been more than just a vending event. It is a true community. I genuinely enjoy vending here, not just for the chance to share my products, but for the joy I see on people’s faces when they find something they love. That feeling alone makes it all worth it.</p>
    <p>What makes this space so special is the energy. Being surrounded by like-minded individuals who are passionate, creative, and open makes you feel right at home. The seshes, the dabs, the laughs, and the love made it feel like family. It was welcoming in the best way possible.</p>
    <p>Sharing ideas with other artisans, trading goods, and enjoying food together meant a lot to me. It is always something I looked forward to each month. That sense of unity and mutual respect is rare and powerful.</p>
    <p>This is what cannabis should look like. A culture built on connection, creativity, and community. The Third Eye Craft Affair reflects everything beautiful about this movement.</p>

    <p class="quote-text">“My first Teca which happen to be in the middle of winter. Honestly was one of the better events I’ve been to in a while…. First off the energy of the ppl the vendors was just 🔥 everyone one was super friendly wasn’t a clique type of place which I appreciated. The attendees were awesome couldn’t believe how packed it was for winter. Food and music was also on point and it wasn’t so loud you can’t talk to the person next to you which was also a huge bonus!</p>
    <p class="quote-text">From a vending perspective… super fare price which most events don’t have imo. I honestly would put this event up there with some of the bigger events I’ve attended. Even though it’s smaller it was still just as productive.. I would recommend this event to any vendors or ppl wanting to check out some culture!!!”</p>
