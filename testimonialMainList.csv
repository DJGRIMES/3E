Vendor Email,"My first Teca which happen to be in the middle of winter. Honestly was one of the better events I've been to in a while…. First off the energy of the ppl the vendors was just 🔥 everyone one was super friendly wasn’t a (clique type of place which I appreciated. The attendees were awesome couldn’t believe how packed it was for winter. Food and music was also on point and it wasn’t so loud you can’t talk to the person next to you which was also a huge bonus! From a vending perspective… super fare price which most events don’t have imo. I honestly would put this event up there with some of the bigger events I’ve attended. Even though it’s smaller it was still just as productive.. I would recommend this event to any vendors or ppl wanting to check out some culture !!!"
